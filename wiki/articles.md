#### Noun
    
    1. Is the noun countable or uncountable?
        A noun is countable if you can have more than one instance of it
    2. Is it singular or plural?
        Am I referring to more than one instance of something?
    3. Is it definite or indefinite?  
        A noun is definite when it is clear to your reader which specific instance or instances of an entity you are referring to; 
        otherwise it is indefinite. Often the first use of a noun is indefinite and subsequent uses are definite.
