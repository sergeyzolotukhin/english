    Subject–Verb–Object
    Subject-Verb-Object-Manner-[at,on,in,by?]-Place-[at,in,on?,by?]-Time

### Word Order in Negative Sentences
    subject + auxiliary + not + main verb.
    subject + modal + not + primary auxiliary + main verb.

        If the verb phrase does not already contain one of these verbs, then it is necessary to add the supporting auxiliary verb do.
